A detailed description of the CSV files uploaded to the drive and what they mean. 

`Student_Growth`: This file contains the average percent of student growth achieved in English/Language Arts, Mathematics, and English Language Proficiency. The statistics reported are those used within Delaware Student Success Framework (DSSF) since 2018. Each student has a growth target to achieve in ELA (grades 4-8), Math (grades 4-8), and, if an English Learner, in English Language Proficiency (grades K-12). The average percent of student growth achieved statistic shows, on average, how close a group of students came to achieving their target. (Source: Delaware Open Data)

`Student_Assessment_Performance`: This file contains the number of tested students, proficient students, and the corresponding proficiency rate for the key annual assessments administered during a given school year. (Source: Delaware Open Data)

`Unemployment_County`: Data on the unemployment rate and employment rate of the civilian labor force at the county level. This data is from 2010-2019. (Source: ACS)

`Unemployment_Census`: Data on the unemployment rate and employment rate of the civilian labor force at the census tract level. This data is from 2010-2019. (Source: ACS)

`Crime_Diseases`: Fatal crime rates and other health conditions like Arthritis, Asthma, Cancer, Cancer-related Deaths, Binge Drinking in the state of Delaware. This data is at the state level 2015 - 2020, couldnâ€™t find it at a more granular level.
